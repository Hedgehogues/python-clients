# Python-clients

This library implements wrapper for different python interfaces. We have:

* sync and async http client (requests and aiohttp)
* mongodb client

Each client is class with request method and class implemented base class of any custom methods. This is very simple. 
But you can encapsulate inner structure of requests.

# Installation

We use python3.7. Installation is a very simple:

    pip install python-clients
